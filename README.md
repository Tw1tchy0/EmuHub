> A unified launcher for all your emulators — one place to browse, organize, and launch your entire game library.

## What is EmuHub?

EmuHub is a single desktop application that brings every emulator you have into one clean interface. Browse your full game collection across all consoles, click a game, and it launches instantly in the correct emulator — no switching between programs, no digging through folders.

**Box art is fetched automatically** via SteamGridDB. Configure it once and every game in your library gets its cover art with no manual work.

## System Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10 (21H2 or later) or Windows 11
- **Runtime:** Microsoft Edge WebView2 (pre-installed on Windows 11; `BUILD.bat` installs it automatically on Windows 10)
- **To run the `.exe`:** Nothing else required — double-click and go
- **To build from source:** Python 3.10 or later (see below)
- **Box art:** Internet connection + free SteamGridDB account (optional)


---

## Getting Started

### Option A — Just run it (no Python needed)

1. Go to the [**Releases**](../../releases) page
2. Download `EmuHub.exe`
3. Double-click it — that's it

> If you see a WebView2 error, run `BUILD.bat` once or [install WebView2 manually](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).

---

### Option B — Build from source

1. Install [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check **"Add Python to PATH"** during setup
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Double-click **`BUILD.bat`**

`BUILD.bat` will automatically:
- Check for Python and guide you if it's missing
- Install the Visual C++ Redistributable if needed
- Install the WebView2 Runtime if needed
- Install Python dependencies (`pywebview`, `pyinstaller`)
- Compile everything into a single portable `dist\EmuHub.exe`

---

## First-Time Setup

1. **Launch EmuHub**
2. Click **⚙ SETTINGS** in the top-right corner
3. **ROM PATHS tab** — point each console at the folder containing its ROMs
4. **EMULATORS tab** — point each console at its emulator `.exe`
5. Click **SAVE CHANGES** — your library populates instantly

### Auto-detecting emulators

Open **Settings → AUTO-DETECT** and click **SCAN NOW**. EmuHub searches your system for known emulator executables and lists what it finds. Click **Apply** on any result to use it.

### Box art (optional)

1. Create a free account at [steamgriddb.com](https://www.steamgriddb.com)
2. Go to **Profile → Preferences → API → Generate API Key**
3. In EmuHub, open **Settings → API KEY**, paste your key, and click **SAVE**

Box art loads automatically for every game and is cached locally — it only downloads once.

---

## Custom / Unsupported Emulators

Use **Settings → OTHER** to add any emulator that isn't in EmuHub's built-in list:

- Set the emulator name, `.exe` path, ROM folder, and supported file extensions
- The emulator appears as a new console category in the sidebar
- EmuHub validates file types at launch — files with unsupported extensions are rejected

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| Windows only | EmuHub uses Windows-specific APIs (DPAPI, WebView2, Win32). macOS/Linux are not supported. |
| Emulators not included | You must install emulators separately. EmuHub is a launcher, not an emulator. |
| ROMs not included | You must supply your own ROM files. |
| Box art requires account | Automatic box art requires a free [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com) API key. |
| API key is user-bound | The SteamGridDB key is encrypted with Windows DPAPI and tied to your Windows user account. It cannot be transferred to another machine. |

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Areas where contributions are most useful:

- **New emulator signatures** — add entries to `EMU_SIGNATURES` in `main.py` for emulators not yet listed
- **New console support** — add to `CONSOLE_EXTS`, `DEFAULT_ROM_PATHS`, and `DEFAULT_EMULATORS`
- **Bug fixes** — open an issue first for anything significant
- **UI improvements** — the entire frontend lives in `src/web/index.html`

Please do **not** submit PRs that include ROM files, BIOS files, emulator executables, or decryption keys.
